# WhatToCook

WhatToCook helps you create your own personalized meal plan based on meals that you and your familiy frequently like to eat.

You can type your favorite meals in different categories: meals with fish, potatoes, rice, or pasta, stews or even no-garnish meals like pizza or wraps.

After this, you are able to generate your personal meal plan. You will become all different meals randomly selected from each category. If you don't like this meal plan, feel free to generate a new one. You are even able to replace a single dish from every category.

Copy and share your favorite meals with your friends. Feel free to delete a meal from your personal list if you don't like it anymore.
